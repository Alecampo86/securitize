Securitize Challenge

Welcome to my Securitize Challenge Repository. Here is a brief overview of the challenges I encountered while building this app using NestJS, React, and the Bootstrap library.

NestJS:

One challenge was setting up the API to fetch data from the Etherscan API using the provided API key.
I set up an Etherscan service to make requests to the Etherscan API and parse the JSON response.
I also implemented a Mongo DB database cluster to store, find and delete the Wallets. 

React:

I designed the dashboard interface using the Bootstrap library and tryed to make it intuitive and easy to use. 
I implemented a WalletContext to handle the different states and methods and make them available across the app.

Just clone the repo, install dependencies using 'npm install' from the server folder and 'npm run start' to start the server on port 3000. 

I hope you like it!
